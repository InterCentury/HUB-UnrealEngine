- [ ] **Install Unreal Engine:** Select the latest stable version (e.g., 5.x).
- [ ] **Create First Project:** Explore the project browser. Select a "Blank" or "First Person" template.
- [ ] **Understand Project Structure:** Examine folders created on hard drive (Config, Content, Source).

### 1.2 Navigating the Interface
- [ ] **The Viewport:** 3D navigation techniques (Alt + LMB / RMB / MMB).
- [ ] **The Content Browser:** Asset import and organization.
- [ ] **The Details Panel:** Property modification for selected objects.
- [ ] **The World Outliner:** Hierarchy of all Actors in the level.
- [ ] **The Toolbar:** Play, Stop, and essential controls identification.

### 1.3 Basic Level Design
- [ ] **Manipulate Actors:** Practice moving, rotating, and scaling objects.
- [ ] **Create Basic Geometry:** Use "BSP" or "Geometry" brushes for prototyping shapes (cubes, cylinders).
- [ ] **Add Lights:** Place Directional Light, Point Light, and Spot Light in the level.
- [ ] **Apply Basic Materials:** Create a simple material and apply to geometry.

## 🧱 Phase 2: Core Concepts - Building Blocks of a Game

*Fundamental systems that constitute every Unreal Engine game.*

### 2.1 Actors & Components
- [ ] **Understand Actors:** Almost everything in a level is an Actor.
- [ ] **Understand Components:** Components (e.g., Static Mesh, Camera, Particle System) add functionality to an Actor.
- [ ] **Create a Custom Actor:** Create a new Blueprint class based on an Actor.
- [ ] **Add Components in Blueprint:** Practice adding and configuring components within a custom Actor.

### 2.2 Introduction to Blueprints (Visual Scripting)
- [ ] **What are Blueprints?** Distinguish between Level Blueprint and Class Blueprint.
- [ ] **The Blueprint Editor:** Familiarization with Graph, My Blueprint panel, and Details panel.
- [ ] **Variables:** Creation and usage of Variables (Integer, Float, Boolean, String).
- [ ] **Functions:** Creation of simple custom functions.
- [ ] **Events:** Usage of Event BeginPlay and Event Tick.
- [ ] **Basic Logic:** Implementation of simple logic using "Print String" nodes.
- [ ] **Casting:** Communication methods between different Blueprints.

### 2.3 Input & Player Interaction
- [ ] **Project Settings - Input:** Bind actions (e.g., Jump, Shoot) and axes (e.g., MoveForward, Turn) to keys, mouse, or gamepad.
- [ ] **Implement in Character/Pawn:** Use input nodes in Character Blueprint's Event Graph for movement and looking.
- [ ] **Interaction:** Create a simple "pickup" system where key press and overlap with an item triggers disappearance.

## 🎨 Phase 3: Building Your World - Art & Environments

*Methods to enhance game world aesthetics.*

### 3.1 Materials Deep Dive
- [ ] **Material Basics:** Understanding Material inputs (Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, Normal).
- [ ] **Textures:** Import textures and apply to materials.
- [ ] **Material Instances:** Create instances for efficient material variations.
- [ ] **Simple Material Functions:** Create effects like scrolling textures for water or blinking lights.

### 3.2 Landscapes & Foliage
- [ ] **Create a Landscape:** Sculpt and paint terrain.
- [ ] **Apply Landscape Materials:** Use layers to paint different textures (grass, rock, dirt) onto landscape.
- [ ] **Foliage Tool:** Paint grass, trees, and rocks onto landscape.

### 3.3 Lighting & Post-Processing
- [ ] **Lighting Basics:** Experiment with different light types and settings (Intensity, Color, Temperature).
- [ ] **Light Mobility:** Distinguish between Static, Stationary, and Movable lights.
- [ ] **Build Lighting:** Understanding "Building Lighting" and appropriate timing.
- [ ] **Post-Process Volume:** Add a Post-Process Volume to control overall level appearance (color grading, bloom, depth of field).

## 🧠 Phase 4: Game Mechanics & Logic

*Implementation of game rules and systems.*

### 4.1 User Interface (UI) with UMG
- [ ] **Create a Widget Blueprint:** Design a simple HUD.
- [ ] **UI Elements:** Add Text, Buttons, and Images.
- [ ] **Display the HUD:** Create a Widget and add to viewport in Player Controller or Character.
- [ ] **Bind Logic:** Create a button that quits the game or starts a new level.

### 4.2 Collision & Physics
- [ ] **Collision Presets:** Understanding Object Channel and Trace Channel (e.g., WorldStatic, Pawn, Visibility).
- [ ] **Collision Events:** Use "OnComponentBeginOverlap" and "OnComponentHit" to trigger events (e.g., projectile hitting an enemy).
- [ ] **Physics:** Enable "Simulate Physics" on an object for falling and reaction to forces.

### 4.3 Audio
- [ ] **Import Sounds:** Import a WAV file.
- [ ] **Create Sound Cue:** Create a simple Sound Cue (optional for basic use).
- [ ] **Play Sounds:** Use "Play Sound 2D/3D at Location" node to trigger audio from events (e.g., gunshot sound when pressing fire).

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Animation & Polish

*Character animation and player experience refinement.*

### 5.1 Character Animation
- [ ] **Import a Character Model:** Find and import a free character model (e.g., from Mixamo).
- [ ] **The Skeleton:** Understand relationship between Skeletal Mesh and its Skeleton.
- [ ] **Animation Blueprint:** Create an Animation Blueprint.
- [ ] **State Machines:** Build a simple state machine for Idle, Walk, and Run.
- [ ] **Blend Spaces:** Create a Blend Space to smoothly blend between walking and running based on speed.

### 5.2 Particle Systems (Niagara)
- [ ] **Introduction to Niagara:** Distinguish between Cascade and Niagara.
- [ ] **Create a Simple Effect:** Create a fire or smoke effect.
- [ ] **Emitter Behaviors:** Experiment with spawn rates, particle life, and basic forces.
- [ ] **Attach Effects:** Attach a Niagara system to a socket on a character (e.g., muzzle flash on a gun).

### 5.3 Gameplay Framework
- [ ] **Game Mode:** Set a default Pawn, HUD, and Player Controller for the level.
- [ ] **Player Controller:** Understand role in handling input and possessing a Pawn.
- [ ] **Game State & Player State:** Learn purpose for storing global and per-player information (scores, game status).

## 🚀 Phase 6: First Mini-Project

*Knowledge consolidation through building a small project from scratch.*

### Project Idea: Simple First-Person "Collection" Game
- [ ] **Plan:** Sketch a simple idea. Player runs around a level collecting floating items while avoiding obstacles.
- [ ] **Setup:** Create a new project with the First-Person template.
- [ ] **Level Design:** Build a simple arena using BSP brushes or static meshes.
- [ ] **Collectible Item:**
    - [ ] Create a Blueprint Actor (e.g., a rotating cube).
    - [ ] Add a Static Mesh and a Rotating Movement component.
    - [ ] Add a Sphere Collision component.
    - [ ] On overlap with the player, destroy the item and add 1 to a "Score" variable.
- [ ] **UI:**
    - [ ] Create a Widget Blueprint to display the current score.
    - [ ] Update the score text whenever an item is collected.
- [ ] **Win Condition:**
    - [ ] Keep track of total items in the level.
    - [ ] When score reaches total items, display a "Win!" message on screen.
- [ ] **Polish:** Add simple sounds for collecting items and a post-process effect for atmospheric enhancement.
